  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The introduction of promises and generators in ECMAScript presents an opportunity to dramatically improve the language-level model for writing asynchronous code in ECMAScript.</p>

  <p>A similar proposal was made with <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:deferred_functions">Deferred Functions</a> during ES6 discussions.  The proposal here supports the same use cases, using similar or the same syntax, but directly building upon control flow structures parallel to those of generators, and using promises for the return type, instead of defining custom mechanisms.</p>

  <p>Development of this proposal is happening at <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait">https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait</a>. Please file issues there. Non-trivial contributions are limited to TC39 members but pull requests for minor issues are welcome and encouraged!</p>

    <h1>Status of this proposal</h1>

    <p>This proposal was accepted into Stage 4 of the ECMAScript <a href="https://tc39.github.io/process-document/">spec process</a>. This proposal is [in the process of being incorporated into ECMA-262 itself](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/692).</p>

    <h1>Examples</h1>

    <p>Take the following example, first written using Promises.  This code chains a set of animations on an element, stopping when there is an exception in an animation, and returning the value produced by the final successfully executed animation.</p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">
    function chainAnimationsPromise(elem, animations) {
        let ret = null;
        let p = Promise.resolve(); // current promise
        for(const anim of animations) {
            p = p.then(function(val) {
                ret = val;
                return anim(elem);
            })
        }
        return p.catch(function(e) {
            /* ignore and keep going */
        }).then(function() {
            return ret;
        });
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>Already with promises, the code is much improved from a straight callback style, where this sort of looping and exception handling is challenging.</p>


    <a href="http://taskjs.org">Task.js</a> and similar libraries offer a way to use generators to further simplify the code maintaining the same meaning:

    <pre><code class="javascript">
    function chainAnimationsGenerator(elem, animations) {
        return spawn(function*() {
            let ret = null;
            try {
                for(const anim of animations) {
                    ret = yield anim(elem);
                }
            } catch(e) { /* ignore and keep going */ }
            return ret;
        });
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>This is a marked improvement.  All of the promise boilerplate above and beyond the semantic content of the code is removed, and the body of the inner function represents user intent.  However, there is an outer layer of boilerplate to wrap the code in an additional generator function and pass it to a library to convert to a promise.  This layer needs to be repeated in every function that uses this mechanism to produce a promise.  This is so common in typical async Javascript code, that there is value in removing the need for the remaining boilerplate.</p>

    <p>With async functions, all the remaining boilerplate is removed, leaving only the semantically meaningful code in the program text:</p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">
    async function chainAnimationsAsync(elem, animations) {
        let ret = null;
        try {
            for(const anim of animations) {
                ret = await anim(elem);
            }
        } catch(e) { /* ignore and keep going */ }
        return ret;
    }
    </code></pre>
