    <p>The abstract operation AsyncFunctionCreate requires the arguments: _kind_ which is one of (~Normal~, ~Method~, ~Arrow~), a parameter list production specified by |ParameterList|, a body production specified by |Body|, a Lexical Environment specified by _Scope_, and a Boolean flag _Strict_. AsyncFunctionCreate performs the following steps:</p>
    <emu-alg>
      1. Let _functionPrototype_ be the intrinsic object %AsyncFunctionPrototype%.
      2. Let _F_ be ! FunctionAllocate(_functionPrototype_, _Strict_, `"non-constructor"`).
      3. Return ! FunctionInitialize(_F_, _kind_, |ParameterList|, |Body|, _Scope_).

      1. Let _runningContext_ be the running execution context.
      1. Let _asyncContext_ be a copy of _runningContext_.
      1. Set the code evaluation state of _asyncContext_ such that when evaluation is resumed for that execution context the following steps will be performed:
        1. Let _result_ be the result of evaluating _asyncFunctionBody_.
        1. Assert: If we return here, the async function either threw an exception or performed an implicit or explicit return; all awaiting is done.
        1. Remove _asyncContext_ from the execution context stack and restore the execution context that is at the top of the execution context stack as the running execution context.
        1. If _result_.[[type]] is ~normal~, then
          1. Perform ! Call(_promiseCapability_.[[Resolve]], *undefined*, «*undefined*»).
        1. Else if _result_.[[type]] is ~return~, then
          1. Perform ! Call(_promiseCapability_.[[Resolve]], *undefined*, «_result_.[[value]]»).
        1. Else,
          1. Assert: _result_.[[type]] is ~throw~.
          1. Perform ! Call(_promiseCapability_.[[Reject]], *undefined*, «_result_.[[value]]»).
        1. Return.
      1. Push _asyncContext_ onto the execution context stack; _asyncContext_ is now the running execution context.
      1. Resume the suspended evaluation of _asyncContext_. Let _result_ be the value returned by the resumed computation.
      1. Assert: When we return here, _asyncContext_ has already been removed from the execution context stack and _runningContext_ is the currently running execution context.
      1. Assert: _result_ is a normal completion with a value of *undefined*. The possible sources of completion values are AsyncFunctionAwait or, if the async function doesn't await anything, the step 3.7 above.
      1. Return.

      1. Let _onRejected_ be a new built-in function object as defined in <a href="#async-function-definitions-awaited-rejected">AsyncFunction Awaited Rejected</a>.
      1. Set _onFulfilled_ and _onRejected_'s [[AsyncContext]] internal slots to _asyncContext_.
      1. Let _throwawayCapability_ be NewPromiseCapability(%Promise%). <!-- Kind of lame. This is the equivalent of ignoring the return value -->
      1. Perform ! PerformPromiseThen(_promiseCapability_.[[Promise]], _onFulfilled_, _onRejected_, _throwawayCapability_).
      1. Remove _asyncContext_ from the execution context stack and restore the execution context that is at the top of the execution context stack as the running execution context.
      1. Set the code evaluation state of _asyncContext_ such that when evaluation is resumed with a Completion _resumptionValue_ the following steps will be performed:
        1. Return _resumptionValue_.
      1. Return.

     <!-- could factor out the first four steps into something like "let _resolveResult_ be PromiseCoerce(_value_)" that is guaranteed to never throw -->

    <emu-note>The return value of this abstract operation is unused. The interesting return is that of _resumptionValue_ being returned to the |AwaitExpression| production that originally called this abstract operation.</emu-note>
